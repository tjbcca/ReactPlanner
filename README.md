# React Schedule Planner

This Schedule Planner allows you to input a starting date and then add days to the page with boxes for you to fill in with information. The + and - buttons add and remove date boxes respectively. At the top of the screen is a section for the title of your schedule. Once the schedule is complete the site can be zoomed in and out of to adjust the size and then screenshot to save it.
